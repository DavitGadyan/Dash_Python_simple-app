# Python_Dash_app

Dear guys,
Here is a simple application created on the basis of Python Dash framework. This framework is relatively new but it has rich tools 
for a data-scientist who want to deliver a project to the Web. 

This is a very simple app and only introduces to the basics of Python.

Few Words about dataset used. The dataset is Stack Overflow Developer Survey, 2017. Here is link, if you are interested: https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data

I have played a little bit with the original dataset, so if you want to explore the dataset you may find the link to it below.
