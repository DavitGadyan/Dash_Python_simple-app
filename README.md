# Python_Dash_app

Dear guys,
Here is a simple application created on the basis of Python Dash framework. This framework is relatively new but it has rich tools 
for a data-scientist who want to deliver a project to the Web. 

This is a very simple app and only introduces to the basics of Python.

Few Words about dataset used. The dataset is Stack Overflow Developer Survey, 2017. Here is link, if you are interested: https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data

I will share a link to the dataset on GoogleDrive.. I have played a little bit with the original dataset))).
