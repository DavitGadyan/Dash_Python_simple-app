Python_Dash_app

Dear guys,
Here is a simple application created on the basis of Python Dash framework. This framework framework is relatively new but it has rich tools 
for a data-scientist who want to deliver a project to the Web. 

This is a very simple app and only introduces to the basics of Python.
